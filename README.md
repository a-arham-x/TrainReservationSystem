# TrainReservationSystem
A simple Train Ticket Reservation System created as a Project for 1st Semester

For our Fundamentals of Programming Semester Project, we created a Train Reservation System.
It is able to take customer information, display the tickets and give the total. 
Every seat's booking information is stored in local files, and is updated whenever a change is made.
The System works on local travel within cities in Pakistan.
